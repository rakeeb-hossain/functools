// Reduce consumes a slice of a generic type and an initial value. It reduces the slice to a single value by applying
// the binary reducer function to each successive element in the slice.
//
// Vacuously, empty slices return the initial value provided.
//
// reducer should be error-safe. It should handle any errors internally and return the desired type.
// If other arguments are required by reducer, reducer should be made a closure with the appropriate
// variables referenced.
